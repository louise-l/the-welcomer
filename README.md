### What is the project about ? 
The Welcomer is a SaaS that helps new employees to onboard easily in their new company. 
The onboard is a challenging phase where the newcomer has to learn his new missions and habits. This important moment shall not be underestimated as the first impression of a company will determine if he wants to stay and work well. 

The Welcomer will help the newcomer with : 
* Operational onboarding : know and master the missions
* Relational onboarding : social integration 
* Administrative onboarding : sign and take notice of documents

### Origin of the project 
This project was made by a team of 4, as our final project in Le Wagon Lille. The Welcomer project is after an original idea of Louise Longle, who pitched it, and convinced other wagonners to join her team. Altogether, we started from a tangible issue, and thought about how a webapp could solve it. 
In the 10 days final days of our bootcamp, we created and coded this project. 

### Features 
The main goal of this app is to make the onboarding phase easier for everyone. In order to make this happen, here are some of the features in the app : 
* A board to follow the progress of comprehension of each mission 
* A **chat** to make communication smoother
* An **event planner** and meetings controller. 
* Libraries where to exchange documents 
* A teammate board, to get to know better the people of your team.
